# Convolutional Neural Network: Dog Breed Classifier

## Introduction
For this project, I set out to create a dog breed classifier (133 breeds) with an accuracy at or above 90% using Python. Throughout this project, I explored various models and model structures, beginning with ResNet-18 and ending with a cocktail of concatenated convolutional neural networks (CCCNN). The initial exploratory stages (sections 1-3) were imperative for my personal growth, although, less interesting. So I’ve condensed these three sections to quickly jump to section 4. Please, stick around until my favorite section, “Jessie and Friends.”
